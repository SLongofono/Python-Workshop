A whirlwind introduction to Python scripting
==============================================

This repository is a stand-alone workshop developed by the KU chapter of the ACM, designed to introduce
novice programmers to Python scripting.  The beginning consists of a brief overview of syntax, which segues
into an overview of a boilerplate application.  Participants fill in their parts of the skeleton application to
create a simple GUI that displays weather data and radar for their area.

The workshop was designed to span about an hour, so much of the application code is already present.
This application was modified from a more extensive previous version to fit the shorter time format
See the slideshow for a guided overview of the material, and the "complete_example" directory for its namesake.

This workshop is suitable for freshman CS students with high school programming experience, or non-majors with
an interest in basic Python file and data manipulation.

###### Note to the style police - The project files use block comments for informational sections, and line comments for others.  This approach makes it easier for participants to quickly identify where they need to modify code, since our text editors highlight line comments in bright colors.  Please refrain from death threats and name-calling.
